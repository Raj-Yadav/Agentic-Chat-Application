    "question": "What is an Income Share Agreement (ISA) and how is it different from a loan?",
    "answer": "An Income Share Agreement (ISA) is a financial arrangement where a student agrees to pay a percentage of their future income for a set period of time in exchange for funding their education. Unlike a traditional loan, which requires fixed monthly payments and accrues interest, an ISA's payments are contingent on the student's income level after graduation. If the student does not earn above a certain threshold, they do not make payments.\n\nFor more information about programs offered by SynergisticIT, you should contact us at: https://www.synergisticit.com/contact-us/",
