## Additional Program Details & FAQs
- **Bootcamp vs SynergisticIT**: SynergisticIT operates as a hybrid staffing agency and workforce development firm, not just a bootcamp. Instructors are industry professionals with 15+ years of experience. We actively market candidates to a proprietary database of 24,000+ clients and offer unlimited post-job support for career longevity.
- **Non-CS Degrees**: Yes, candidates without a Computer Science degree can join the Job Placement Program (JOPP). The curriculum is designed to equip candidates with practical, high-demand coding skills that employers value over degrees.
- **Data Science Depth**: The Data Science track is comprehensive and covers Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and NLP (Sentiment Analysis, Tokenization, LLMs).
- **Certifications**: We provide preparation for industry-accredited certifications (AWS, Oracle/Java, Azure) at no additional cost.
- **Java Full Stack Tech**: Covers Backend (Core Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, Hibernate), Frontend (HTML5, CSS, React, Angular), Databases (SQL, MongoDB), and DevOps (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes).
- **MERN Stack**: Yes, the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) is fully integrated into the Full Stack curriculum.
- **Data Engineering**: Yes, the curriculum includes essential Data Engineering tools such as Hadoop, Apache Spark (PySpark), Snowflake, and Databricks.
- **Daily Commitment**: For the full-time immersive option, candidates should expect a 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM (PST) schedule. The program lasts 4-6 months requiring significant daily effort.
- **Switching Tracks**: It is strongly recommended to select the correct track before starting. Switching tracks mid-program may require restarting specific modules as curriculums are distinct.
- **Instructors**: Instructors are industry experts and experienced professionals currently working in the tech sector, not recent graduates.
